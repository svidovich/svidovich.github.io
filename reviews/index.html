      <hr />
      Sometimes you're on a website and you're not sure if it's legit or not.
      I've been there, and I've hucked the money into an infinite void just to
      see what would happen. These are the reviews from the times when I did it.
      Maybe ( just maybe ) you'll have good experiences, too. ( If you're lucky
      )

        I wanted to try learning Serbian from kids' schoolbooks for a more
        'natural' approach to language now that I've got the basics of Serbian
        down. This should help me expand my vocabulary! Luckily, Vulkan has a
        section for kids' textbooks, and I ordered 10 with DHL express shipping
        for about $120. This is super cheap even by domestic American standards.
        I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase and how quickly it got
        here!

        I was looking for a place to find a kabanica -- a traditional
        Yugoslavian folk jacket -- but options are shockingly limited. Many
        stores exist, but very few operate on the internet. That's a shame. One
        that's out there is Margaret-Design. They specialize in Slovakian
        national costume, but their version of the kabanica is
        <em>just about the same</em> as the Yugoslavian variant ( perhaps with a
        touch more decoration! ), so I pulled the trigger. It took some doing:
        we had to do a bank transfer, which was terrifying, because I'd never
        done it before. No less, the money landed and the most beautiful jacket
        I've seen arrived a little while later. You can find my specific jacket

        here as well, seemingly available on-request. I can strongly recommend
        this site!

        So, my dad is from former Yugoslavia, and I'm trying to learn the
        language. Suffice to say there are not very many resources. I've been
        doing OK so far, but thought it'd be a good idea to get some childrens'
        books. Along comes
        <a href="https://serbianshop.com/">serbianshop.com</a>, which made me
        nervous from the second I landed on it. I got to the payment method and
        my options were PayPal or 'some obsucre Italian Bank'. $80 in! What
        comes out? A month later, I'm sitting at my desk... programming. Ding
        dong! ??? I wasn't expecting any visitors. There it is! A mail carrier
        with a package that says 'BEOGRAD' in the top left corner. I'm
        <em>very</em> happy with my order, and I can't wait to buy even more
        books, flutes, toys... hats... vests? Shoes? What don't they have?
