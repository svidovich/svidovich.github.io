    <h1>Narodna Nošnja: National Costumes</h1>
    This is my dumping ground for anything and everything to do with cool balkan
    costumes :)

    <h3>2025-02-23 // Baby-Sized Ćemer</h3>
    The <strong>ćemer</strong> is a particular piece of national costume that's
    very much dear to my heart. It's a large, long leather belt that often has a
    pocket up front. It has many names -- ćemer is what it's called where my
    family is from, but it's called a pašnjača among the Vrlikans, and a silav
    -- after the bensilah, a Turkish implement of similar appearance -- among
    the eastern Serbs.<br />

    In my days I've only ever seen one in person that I didn't make, and it
    belonged to my grandfather. They're rather rare, most especially in the
    United States. It was actually my inspiration for learning leather working
    in the first place.
    <br />
    I've made something like five or six of them at this point. I thought it'd
    be a good idea to make one for my son ( coming soon! ), so I came up with a
    rough outline of what I thought I wanted.

    It's going to be somewhat different from the others I've made -- it'll be
    more in the 'bensilah' style, where it has a front strap for holding on to a
    weapon. Probably a cute little wooden sword. I also want it to be able to
    hold cute little jingly bells. Off we go.<br />

    I've got plenty of veg tan in good shape laying around, so I just got to
    work. I made it something like 11x5 -- typically, I'd go taller, but he's
    just going to be a little thing. It's small enough that I can put it on him,
    but big enough that it'll last him until he's a toddler.
    <br />
    Many folk use a wing divider for adding their edge lines. I've got the
    pleasure of owning a very heavy industrial drafting compass, given to me by
    the late
    <a

    >, a close family friend.
    <br />
    Lining is followed by beveling, which removes any excess and makes for a
    nice clean edge to work with later on when it's time to slick down the
    fibres.

    Now we prep to dye the leather. The front strap will remain nude and so
    receives no dye. The main body, though, I'll dye with Fiebing's Dark Brown
    Pro Dye. Why this one? Good question. It pulls up something fierce. I've
    gone to the ends of the galaxy to prevent it, too.
    <br />
    I use simple kindergarten foam brushes for laying dye. I'd use the wooly
    daubers, but they just don't provide the same level of coverage! Either
    one's pretty cheap, though.
    <br />
    The dye station is just garbage bags and plastic cups, like the overrated
    high school parties we felt so bad missing out on while we played RuneScape
    long into the evening.

    <br />
    Once the dye is laid, I typically like to let it cure for a long time.
    Overnight will usually do. I dip-dyed the little belt because it was small
    enough to fit in the solo cup, and it actually wound up needing another coat
    the next day. That's alright.
    <br />
    Pro dye lays down pretty matte. Whether it's even or not is a trick of the
    hand ( and maybe the eye ), but it'll all shake out in post anyway.

    Before I apply any top coat I'll seal the flesh side ( the yucky back ) with
    a mixture of neatsfoot oil and beeswax. I prepared pucks another time that's
    about a 50/50 mixture by weight. You can do a double-boil setup on the
    stove, it works pretty well. I put them in little cupcake tins and popped
    them in the freezer.
    <br />
    The beeswax keeps it coherent and the neatsfoot oil will help make the
    leather more pliable. It'll darken up the back. You can apply a coat at a
    time, then melt it in with a hairdrier. It does very well, and the results
    speak for themselves.

    <br />
    Next, we do a top coat. The recipe is the same for both the nude parts and
    for the dyed. We start out with a leather conditioner ( just a Lexol will do
    ) to get some moisture into the grain side. Once that's dry, we can
    optionally add an oil -- mink or neatsfoot -- if it's not feeling flexible
    yet ( hard to believe ). We finally buff in carnauba creme and let it stand
    for a while. This helps to even out the dye coat.
    <br />
    While that's enough to get the leather hydrated, it's not enough to seal it.
    For that we add two coats of atom wax and blast it with the automatic
    buffer. Oh, the automatic buffer. It gives us an incredible shine, and a
    waxy protective coat. The shine is beautiful and glossy!

    I come up with a quick belt buckle. The buckle itself is made out of
    stainless steel ( good for longevity, eh ). I made the keeper out of some
    veg tan, stapled together with an eyelet and some glue. We make two of
    these.

    <br />
    While we're getting the attachments together, we can prep the belt strap.
    Instead of making a whole new belt every time he puts on another five
    pounds, I can just make a quick new strap. This first one has 12 usable
    inches.

    <br />
    We attach the belt buckle to the main body using rivets and burrs. I attach
    it lightly at first so that I can make sure that I've got it square off the
    edge.
    <br />
    The rivet and burr tool has two parts -- an open hole for pushing the washer
    down around the shaft of the rivet, and a dish for flattening the rivet.
    Before using the dished side, we use nippers to cut down the shaft of the
    rivet. Then we can smush the remaining rivet over, preventing the washer
    from raising above the newly peened edge.
    <br />
    This rivet will outlive us all.

    The front strap requires a little decoration. We add a little uhh... circle?
    That's decorative. Traditionally, ćemers have rivets and eyelets, so we'll
    do some of those, too. Eyelet tools are simple to use! Or are they? I just
    learned you're <em>supposed</em> to put the 'face' of it downward, against
    the tool, and the striker fits inside the butt. Weird.

    Now we're on the home stretch. We use our weaver forks to punch holes for
    sewing. Some dewds just use a stitching pony and an awl. I like to punch
    ahead of time. Different strokes. I'm not making money, so time isn't
    exactly of the essence, here.

    I don't use a stitching pony --
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLPkVvI9yFg" target="_blank"
      >Corter Leather on YouTube</a
    >
    teaches a method where you sort of do a 'leap frog'. It's plenty tight for
    my purposes. We sew the front strap onto the front body piece first. Then we
    sew the body onto the back! Dodge the straps. It came out a little bound
    because there was an off-by-one in the top left with the holes, but nothing
    a little brute force can't fix :)
    <br />
    This is ~ technically ~ the last step.

          potkolenice'. Oni nose Vrlične kostobrane oko Uskrsu dok oni vežbaju
          običaj 'Čuvanje Hristovog groba'. U ovim slicama, ti možeš da vidiš
          Vrlični muškarci u nošni, na nogama nose svoje kostobrane. Nedavno ja
          sam našao sliku muškarca koji je nosio nošnju sa Korduna. Na njegovim
          čakširama, vidiš šaru petlje. Ja sam želio da napravim kostobrane sa
          ovom šarom, i tako ja bih imao kostobrane 'sa Korduna'...! Ja sam
          napravio moje kostobrane od sintetičkog filca, kože, i pamuka. Mislim
          da prave kostobrane su izrađene od vune, ali teško ja da nađem vunu
          ovđe. Ja sam kupio kožu iz lokalne prodavonice, i ja sam postavio
          boju. I pamuk je... zgodan -- možeš da ga nađeš svugde, ovđe. Posle
          toga, šio sam sve. Počeo sam u Maj, i ja sam završio u Jul. Ja sam
          naučio kako da vezem na ovim, i zadovoljan sam sa mojom radom. Crven i
          Crn je "tema" što mnogo volim: moj prvi pojas je crven i crn, i moje
          kostobrane takođe. Uskoro, ja ću da napravim pravu, graničarsku
          kabanicu, i će biti crvenu takođe! Možda treba da napravim pašnjaču sa
          crnom i crvenom bojama, kao oni imaju tamo... U međuvrijemena, pravim
          mnoge šajkače, Ličke kape, i šubare. Ja ću da ih prodajem na 'Serb
          Fest', koji je velika žurka što moja crkva ima u Septembar. Možda mi
          ćemo da se videmo tamo :)

          In Vrlika, they have a piece of costume which is called "shin guards".
          They wear Vrlikan shinguards around Easter while they practice the
          custom of "Watching Christ's Tomb". In these pictures, you can see
          Vrlikan men in costume, on their legs they wear their shin guards.
          Recently I found an image of a man who wore costume from Kordun. On
          his pants, you see a pattern of a loop. I wanted to make shin guards
          with this pattern, so that I would have shin guards "from Kordun"...!
          I made my shin guards from synthetic felt, leather, and cotton. I
          think that real shin guards are made of 'vuna' ( a special home-made
          wool ), but it's difficult to find vuna here. I bought the leather
          from a local shop, and I set the color. And cotton is... handy -- you
          can find it everywhere, here. After that, I sewed everything. I
          started in May, and I finished in July. I learned how to embroider on
          these, and I'm satisfied with my work. Red and black is a "theme" that
          I like a lot: my first pojas ( a woven, cloth belt ) is red and black,
          and my shin guards as well. Soon, I'll make a real, border-guard's
          kabanica ( a long. often red cloak ), and it'll be red as well! Maybe
          I should make a pašnjača ( a Vrlikan leather belt ) like they have
          there... In the meantime, I'm making a lot of šajkačas ( _the_ Serbian
          hat ), Lika caps ( round hats from Lika ), and šubaras ( tall, fluffy
          hats). I'll sell them at 'Serb Fest', which is a big party that my
          church has in September. Maybe we'll see each other there :)
