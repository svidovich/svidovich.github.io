    <h3>2025-05-26 // Punching Holes; Stainless Belt Plates</h3>
    From my earlier posts, you've learned a bit about what a ćemer is, so I'm
    not going to go in to a ridiculous amount of detail here about that. I have
    a ćemer of my own that I had originally put together in 2022.
    <br />
    <center>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="../media/cemeri-vidovica.jpg"
          width="403"
          height="302"
          class="super-hover"
        />
        <figcaption>
          The collection of ćemers in my family. My personal ćemer in its
          original form is on the right. The only one in this picture that I
          didn't make is my grandfather's, on the left.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>
    <br />
    When I originally made my and my family's belts, I added a little matrix of
    standoffs to them in a 4x4-inch square. You can see them if you look closely
    at the photo above. These are snap bases, and they allow me to create
    decorative "attachments" that I can hook to the belt with ease and remove
    very easily too, as long as I make the attachment with its own 4x4-inch snap
    plate. A great example of what I mean by 'attachments' is my 'Four C
    plaque', a little decorative shield crest with a Serbian cross on it. You
    can see it pretty well in this picture of me, where I'm wearing my belt and
    have a bunch of twtally sick swords.
    <br />
    <center>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="../media/wearing-original-cemer-also-swords.jpg"
          width="307"
          height="408"
          class="super-hover"
        />
        <figcaption>

          into it. My 'Four C' plaque is on the left-hand side. See it?
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>
    <br />
    And indeed, you can also see in the first picture that I attached things
    like...
    <ul>
      <li>A whole-ass knife</li>
      <li>A glass jar with a cork in it</li>
    </ul>
    So! Cute, cool. It works good. The problem that I run into is that the
    attachments with heftier objects on them are really only any good if you're
    more or less standing still. If you try to run with, e.g., a whole-ass knife
    attached, you're going to find yourself knifeless pretty quickly, because
    cheap aluminum snaps weren't meant to hang on to an, e.g., whole-ass knife.
    <br /><br />
    So... what to do, then, if I want more interesting attachments? What I
    decided on was that I wanted to punch holes <i>through</i> my belt and put
    eyelets in them, so that I could tie stuff onto the belt with string or
    leather lace. That would make it so that my cool stuff wouldn't fall off of
    me. I've also been looking for a better way to mount my gigantic-ass gun
    holster, and this would provide a more stable means than
    "two-and-a-half-inch-wide strip of leather riveted to the back of the
    holster". <br /><br />
    I ... didn't take any pictures of the process of...
    <ol>
      <li>Ripping all of the original stitches</li>
      <li>Re-conditioning the leather after three years of besewed-ness</li>
      <li>Punching the new holes</li>
      <li>Installing all of the new eyelets</li>
    </ol>
    Which is shocking. Zero. Like, not one. Less than one picture.
    <br /><br />
    But, that was about the process. I recognizd that just punching the holes
    straight through both layers wouldn't work, because then I wouldn't be able
    to maintain the belt in the future. If the layers are riveted together,
    they'll be damn near impossible to get apart without serious intervention.
    <br /><br />
    So instead, I took the belt apart. I lined up where the holes would go, and
    punched them in both sides. Then I was able to add the eyelets to both
    sides, which worked great.
    <br /><br />
    I took the opportunity to condition the living hell out of the leather.
    Especially where the leather had been bent like at the very top and bottom,
    it was in dire need of a deep conditioning, which I was happy to give. I
    sealed it back up with some atom wax afterward, and wrote '2025' in big
    numerals under the '2022' that was already on the inside.
    <br /><br />
    Sewing it back up was somewhat painful, but distinctly easier than the first
    time. If you don't have to punch all of the holes, it's a significantly
    easier process. Here's what the new attachment areas look like. You can see
    that I don't lose the ability to use my old attachments: the snap bases
    remained in-place. The new holes are just adjacent to the snap bases!

    <br /><br />
    Once the belt was back together, I had to decide what my first attachments
    would be. It was around Easter this year that I decided I wanted to have
    some cool plates. I was sitting on the porch at my parents' house, and my
    dad busted out this gorgeous 16ga stainless that my maternal grandfather had
    in his garage from many years ago as a prize from working at the local
    stainless steel manufacturing plant before it had closed down. It really
    gleamed in the sun. He offered to cut me out some 4x4 squares, with holes
    punched at just the right spots.
    <br /><br />
    Meanwhile, I got to work. In order to get designs worth something, I needed
    to at least passingly learn how to use inkscape. I found a Serbian church
    font, 'Miroslav', to use and got to work (
    <a href="../media/etc/MIROSLN.ttf" target="_blank">download da font</a> ).
    <br /><br />
    Honestly, inkscape doesn't suck. The hardest part for me is knowing what all
    of the little icons mean. You have to hover each one individually, and
    they're very small, especially on linux. No less, it's a very capable piece
    of software.
    <br /><br />
    The font is only half of the problem, though: I wanted it to be a cute logo
    in the center and cool text surrounding it, like some kind of Fullmetal
    Alchemist ripoff. I'm very lucky to have ChatGPT, which was
    <i>shockingly</i> good at turning my ideas into reality. <br /><br />
    A few of the emblems aren't common, so let's add some figures about them
    individually...

          A St. George logo. These are really hard to find, and the ones that
          were out there weren't really what I was looking for. I had ChatGPT
          generate several, and picked the one I liked the best.

          This loopy pattern is the same as the one I added to my shinguards (
          go read my post about those ). I'm gonna go ahead and adopt it as my
          personal seal :D

          This is where the lore gets kinda deep. A friend ( and cousin ) of
          mine on Facebook has done a <i>ton</i> of geneaological research into
          the Gvojić family. She found this seal while researching one day...

          ... so I had ChatGPT turn it into a flat logo. I am
          <i>very</i> impressed and happy with the results! It's not exactly the
          same, but boy does it look good.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      So once I had some logos, it was just a matter of getting inkscape to
      cooperate. Turns out it's <i>very</i> easy to use inkscape to make
      circular text: you just add a circle, some text, and then say "Put on
      Path" in the "Text" menu at the top with both of them selected.
      <br />
      The results are so sick:

    With the designs done and the squares cut, it was time to find someone who
    could help me act on them. I knew I wanted them engraved. Luckily, my wife
    Hannah's friend Liz used to work at a local shop,
    <a href="https://www.theengraversedge.com/" target="_blank"
      >The Engraver's Edge</a
    >, which is handily a 3 minute drive from my house. I walked in with some
    stainless steel squares and a flash drive full of SVGs, and boy did they
    deliver! They were a little worried about whether the steel could handle it
    because of its thin-itude, but they came out just fine.

    All that was left to do was cut out and polish some 4x4 leather. I left it
    nude for contrast against the body of the belt, used a little conditioner,
    and then finished it out with some atom wax. It worked flawlessly :)

    <h3>2025-02-23 // Baby-Sized Ćemer</h3>
    The <strong>ćemer</strong> is a particular piece of national costume that's
    very much dear to my heart. It's a large, long leather belt that often has a
    pocket up front. It has many names -- ćemer is what it's called where my
    family is from, but it's called a pašnjača among the Vrlikans, and a silav
    -- after the bensilah, a Turkish implement of similar appearance -- among
    the eastern Serbs.<br />

    <br />
    In my days I've only ever seen one in person that I didn't make, and it
    belonged to my grandfather. They're rather rare, most especially in the
    United States. It was actually my inspiration for learning leather working
    in the first place.
    <br />
    I've made something like five or six of them at this point. I thought it'd
    be a good idea to make one for my son ( coming soon! ), so I came up with a
    rough outline of what I thought I wanted.

    It's going to be somewhat different from the others I've made -- it'll be
    more in the 'bensilah' style, where it has a front strap for holding on to a
    weapon. Probably a cute little wooden sword. I also want it to be able to
    hold cute little jingly bells. Off we go.<br />

    I've got plenty of veg tan in good shape laying around, so I just got to
    work. I made it something like 11x5 -- typically, I'd go taller, but he's
    just going to be a little thing. It's small enough that I can put it on him,
    but big enough that it'll last him until he's a toddler.
    <br />
    Many folk use a wing divider for adding their edge lines. I've got the
    pleasure of owning a very heavy industrial drafting compass, given to me by
    the late
    <a

    >, a close family friend.
    <br />
    Lining is followed by beveling, which removes any excess and makes for a
    nice clean edge to work with later on when it's time to slick down the
    fibres.

    Now we prep to dye the leather. The front strap will remain nude and so
    receives no dye. The main body, though, I'll dye with Fiebing's Dark Brown
    Pro Dye. Why this one? Good question. It pulls up something fierce. I've
    gone to the ends of the galaxy to prevent it, too.

    I use simple kindergarten foam brushes for laying dye. I'd use the wooly
    daubers, but they just don't provide the same level of coverage! Either
    one's pretty cheap, though.
    <br />
    The dye station is just garbage bags and plastic cups, like the overrated
    high school parties we felt so bad missing out on while we played RuneScape
    long into the evening.

    Once the dye is laid, I typically like to let it cure for a long time.
    Overnight will usually do. I dip-dyed the little belt because it was small
    enough to fit in the solo cup, and it actually wound up needing another coat
    the next day. That's alright.
    <br />
    Pro dye lays down pretty matte. Whether it's even or not is a trick of the
    hand ( and maybe the eye ), but it'll all shake out in post anyway.

    Before I apply any top coat I'll seal the flesh side ( the yucky back ) with
    a mixture of neatsfoot oil and beeswax. I prepared pucks another time that's
    about a 50/50 mixture by weight. You can do a double-boil setup on the
    stove, it works pretty well. I put them in little cupcake tins and popped
    them in the freezer.
    <br />
    The beeswax keeps it coherent and the neatsfoot oil will help make the
    leather more pliable. It'll darken up the back. You can apply a coat at a
    time, then melt it in with a hairdrier. It does very well, and the results
    speak for themselves.

    <br />
    Next, we do a top coat. The recipe is the same for both the nude parts and
    for the dyed. We start out with a leather conditioner ( just a Lexol will do
    ) to get some moisture into the grain side. Once that's dry, we can
    optionally add an oil -- mink or neatsfoot -- if it's not feeling flexible
    yet ( hard to believe ). We finally buff in carnauba creme and let it stand
    for a while. This helps to even out the dye coat.
    <br />
    While that's enough to get the leather hydrated, it's not enough to seal it.
    For that we add two coats of atom wax and blast it with the automatic
    buffer. Oh, the automatic buffer. It gives us an incredible shine, and a
    waxy protective coat. The shine is beautiful and glossy!

    I come up with a quick belt buckle. The buckle itself is made out of
    stainless steel ( good for longevity, eh ). I made the keeper out of some
    veg tan, stapled together with an eyelet and some glue. We make two of
    these.

    <br />
    While we're getting the attachments together, we can prep the belt strap.
    Instead of making a whole new belt every time he puts on another five
    pounds, I can just make a quick new strap. This first one has 12 usable
    inches.

    <br />
    We attach the belt buckle to the main body using rivets and burrs. I attach
    it lightly at first so that I can make sure that I've got it square off the
    edge.
    <br />
    The rivet and burr tool has two parts -- an open hole for pushing the washer
    down around the shaft of the rivet, and a dish for flattening the rivet.
    Before using the dished side, we use nippers to cut down the shaft of the
    rivet. Then we can smush the remaining rivet over, preventing the washer
    from raising above the newly peened edge.
    <br />
    This rivet will outlive us all.

    The front strap requires a little decoration. We add a little uhh... circle?
    That's decorative. Traditionally, ćemers have rivets and eyelets, so we'll
    do some of those, too. Eyelet tools are simple to use! Or are they? I just
    learned you're <em>supposed</em> to put the 'face' of it downward, against
    the tool, and the striker fits inside the butt. Weird.

    Now we're on the home stretch. We use our weaver forks to punch holes for
    sewing. Some dewds just use a stitching pony and an awl. I like to punch
    ahead of time. Different strokes. I'm not making money, so time isn't
    exactly of the essence, here.

    I don't use a stitching pony --
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLPkVvI9yFg" target="_blank"
      >Corter Leather on YouTube</a
    >
    teaches a method where you sort of do a 'leap frog'. It's plenty tight for
    my purposes. We sew the front strap onto the front body piece first. Then we
    sew the body onto the back! Dodge the straps. It came out a little bound
    because there was an off-by-one in the top left with the holes, but nothing
    a little brute force can't fix :)
    <br />
    This is ~ technically ~ the last step.

          U Vrlici, oni imaju deo nošnje što se zove 'kostobrane za

          Vrlični muškarci u nošni, na nogama nose svoje kostobrane. Nedavno ja
          sam našao sliku muškarca koji je nosio nošnju sa Korduna. Na njegovim
          čakširama, vidiš šaru petlje. Ja sam želio da napravim kostobrane sa
          ovom šarom, i tako ja bih imao kostobrane 'sa Korduna'...! Ja sam
          napravio moje kostobrane od sintetičkog filca, kože, i pamuka. Mislim
          da prave kostobrane su izrađene od vune, ali teško ja da nađem vunu
          ovđe. Ja sam kupio kožu iz lokalne prodavonice, i ja sam postavio
          boju. I pamuk je... zgodan -- možeš da ga nađeš svugde, ovđe. Posle
          toga, šio sam sve. Počeo sam u Maj, i ja sam završio u Jul. Ja sam
          naučio kako da vezem na ovim, i zadovoljan sam sa mojom radom. Crven i
          Crn je "tema" što mnogo volim: moj prvi pojas je crven i crn, i moje
          kostobrane takođe. Uskoro, ja ću da napravim pravu, graničarsku
          kabanicu, i će biti crvenu takođe! Možda treba da napravim pašnjaču sa
          crnom i crvenom bojama, kao oni imaju tamo... U međuvrijemena, pravim
          mnoge šajkače, Ličke kape, i šubare. Ja ću da ih prodajem na 'Serb
          Fest', koji je velika žurka što moja crkva ima u Septembar. Možda mi
          ćemo da se videmo tamo :)

          In Vrlika, they have a piece of costume which is called "shin guards".
          They wear Vrlikan shinguards around Easter while they practice the
          custom of "Watching Christ's Tomb". In these pictures, you can see
          Vrlikan men in costume, on their legs they wear their shin guards.
          Recently I found an image of a man who wore costume from Kordun. On
          his pants, you see a pattern of a loop. I wanted to make shin guards
          with this pattern, so that I would have shin guards "from Kordun"...!
          I made my shin guards from synthetic felt, leather, and cotton. I
          think that real shin guards are made of 'vuna' ( a special home-made
          wool ), but it's difficult to find vuna here. I bought the leather
          from a local shop, and I set the color. And cotton is... handy -- you
          can find it everywhere, here. After that, I sewed everything. I
          started in May, and I finished in July. I learned how to embroider on
          these, and I'm satisfied with my work. Red and black is a "theme" that
          I like a lot: my first pojas ( a woven, cloth belt ) is red and black,
          and my shin guards as well. Soon, I'll make a real, border-guard's
          kabanica ( a long. often red cloak ), and it'll be red as well! Maybe
          I should make a pašnjača ( a Vrlikan leather belt ) like they have
          there... In the meantime, I'm making a lot of šajkačas ( _the_ Serbian
          hat ), Lika caps ( round hats from Lika ), and šubaras ( tall, fluffy
          hats). I'll sell them at 'Serb Fest', which is a big party that my
          church has in September. Maybe we'll see each other there :)
