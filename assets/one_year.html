            In summer of 2021, I had a kind of partial awakening of a latent ability to give up things. For a very long time,
            I was a smoker, and this, and that, and the other, and I recognized that it was hampering my true potential. While
            I've long tried to use my discipline to continuously improve myself, I noted that while I was still a smoker --
            while certain addictions still had their hold on me -- I couldn't be who I wanted to be.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>So I stopped.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
            I stopped smoking cigarettes in early August of 2021. I stopped reading Reddit because it gave me anxiety. I deleted
            my FaceBook account, because... oh God. I eventually bailed out of Twitter in... October? I still use social media, but
            not in the same way. It made me realize how poisonous technology and the internet are.
            </p>
            <p>
            But just so, it made me realize how much I love my skillset, and how much I love computers. It made me realize that I
            get to choose -- every day -- the things I want to do. I've picked up a couple of fulfilling hobbies. I am an amateur
            leather worker now. I am a gardener. Soon I'm going to be doing some basic metallurgy. It gave me the energy to focus
            on things that really interested me, and give up focus on things that were hurting me.
            </p>
            <p>
            Still, I never forgot how much I loved programming. I thought it would be a good idea to do something very hard. I wanted
            to complete a full year of github contributions. And I did, in August of 2022.
