      <h3><em>Babine</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        The celebration of a new child before they were born, akin to a baby shower. Instead of presents, food would be
        brought to the party, and it was treated as a social occasion.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Čijanje</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        Similar to <em>prelo</em>, but instead of spinning wool, chicken feathers are prepared for the making of
        pillows.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Kosidba</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">When the people of the village gathered together to cut hay.</p>

      <h3><em>Kukuruzanje</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">When the people of the village gathered together to harvest and husk corn.</p>

      <h3><em>Mačkare</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        The Balkan equivalent of Halloween. For countryside children, eggs would be collected from neighbors instead of
        candy!
      </p>

      <h3>
        <em>Prelo</em>
      </h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        Prelos are meetings of villagers during which wool is spun. While the work is on-going, plenty of traditional
        cultural songs are sung, and plenty of traditional cultural drinks are had!
      </p>

      <h3><em>Prvi Maj</em> or <em>Dan Slobode</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        The first of May is a celebration of the end of World War II for the people of the Balkans.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Sadenje</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        The first sowing of the year, which involved plowing, harrowing, and sowing seeds.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Sajam</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        A market where villagers could buy and sell goods, hosted weekly. Livestock and handmade goods were commonplace,
        as well as "fair food", like sausages, "slatko piće" ( sugar water ), and other treats.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Slava</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        Especially for Serbs, Slavas are feast days based on the day on which their family is said to have converted to
        Orthodoxy. The day of the Slava corresponds to a specific saint.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Zbor</em></h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px">
        A public gathering of villagers for the celebration of a Saint or Saints. This is distinct from a
        <em>Slava</em>, because Slavas are personal to a family. <em>Zbor</em> also refers to any public meeting or
        gathering, formal or informal.
