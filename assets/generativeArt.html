        I'm not an artist. I'm just not. It's not something I have put a
        substantial enough amount of time into that I can realistically do
        anything. I am crafty, sure, but I'm really specifically talking about
        visual art: drawing, painting, sculpting, etc.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        No less, I have lots of artsy ideas. I have lots of things that I would
        like to see made, if I only had the skillset to make them. But between
        learning...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a language</li>
        <li>to make clothing</li>
        <li>embroidery</li>
        <li>leather working</li>
        <li>to program, and more than one programming language</li>
        <li>about operating systems</li>
        <li>Yugoslavian (in a regional sense) anthropology</li>
        <li>the songs and traditions of the Serbian church</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="blogograph">
        I'm just out of time. Not in a, "ah, well I got too old" kind of way. In
        a "I literally do not have enough time in my days to entertain yet
        another hobby" kind of way. If you look through my website, you can see
        how much goofy stuff I get into. Sharing stuff I find and find out for
        free is something I really adore. Still, it's <i>not the half of it</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        So given everything you can see, plus all of the stuff you can't, you
        can probably imagine how much time is left for... literally even one
        additional thing. Zero! Zilch. All of my time is used up. If I could
        mine an extra 2-3 hours out of the day without completely annihilating
        myself, I would. But I can't.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        But I still have ideas. They're not limited to visual art, but this is
        where ChatGPT really comes in wildly handy, because it allows me to
        create art that I <i>never could</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        And, this is why despite that, I sympathize with real artists whom
        ChatGPT is giving a hard time. It comes down to this:
        <strong
          >I know <i>exactly</i> how much time I had to put into my hobbies to
          get to a place where I was even <i>OK at them</i>.</strong
        >
        Not passable, not amateur-ish. To even rise to the level of "novice" at
        <i>anything</i> takes a <i>ton</i> of time, work, soul, and energy. It's
        a hard price that has to be paid.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        To see this machine that's capable of erasing that gap entirely and
        producing stuff that's "<i>kind of alright</i>" or "<i
          >good enough for my purposes</i
        >" has to be frustrating. I understand that. I've felt it with a lot of
        the things that I've learned, that I've worked on. I get it. It feels
        invalidating, and you know that no matter how good the machine is, the
        end result will still have no soul to it. From one person who does hard
        stuff to another, I empathize with you.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        But in kind, what I hope that a visual artist understands is that
        without this technology, none of the visual arts stuff I've been
        dreaming about could realistically be brought to life. As I mentioned
        previously, I am quite literally out of time on stuff that I can
        realistically work on. There's no more time in the day. It's not that I
        do not want to put in the time to learn visual arts, it's that
        <i>there is no time that I am able to spend</i>. The bank is empty. All
        of my hours are pretty well accounted for.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        The ideas I have aren't frivolous ( in my opinion, anyway ). I want to
        generate stuff that relates to the other stuff that I like. Have a look:

        Now I'm sure you can see many flaws all at once. I know they aren't
        perfect. I know that from a real, true, visual arts standpoint, they
        might not even be good. There are weird artefacts and wrong details.
        There are fuzzy parts and things that don't make sense. Even worse: I
        doubt I'll ever be able to fix them.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        But please understand -- these aren't just frivolous things I'm
        generating. To me, this stuff is important, because there's so little
        art that represents the kinds of things I think about so much. You can
        find it in anthropological texts and piecemeal on FaceBook from true
        fans, but beyond that, there's not a lot to see.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        I empathize with you. I really do. I know what it's like to watch people
        choose machine-generated, half-assed trash over well-produced,
        hand-worked outputs. I am a programmer. I've seen the outputs of "vibe
        coding" with AI and they aren't good.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        And I also know that learning to code is out of reach for a lot of
        people. It takes a ton of time and, frankly, <i>is hard</i>. I beat my
        face against the boulder of programming through long days and late
        nights, and only after a ton of effort did I get good at it.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        Even so, there's a certain magic to watching people make their "app
        dreams" come true -- or at least get far enough that they can ask a
        programmer for help. As much as AI generated code disturbs me due to its
        ... quality ...
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        It levels the playing field a bit -- enough that people who would never
        in their wildest dreams think they could create an app or a website can
        at least get started now. And that's <strong>equity</strong> in a new
        and unique way.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        I'm not that excited about AI. I don't like wading through the junk. It
        has been exhausting sifting through other peoples' AI generated code,
        asking them why they did it that way, and then they have no idea. I've
        watched systems break, things just straight up <i>not work</i>, and 1
        week projects take a month.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        But even I have to admit that I'm getting something out of it. And other
        people are, too. What you get out of it depends on who you are and what
        you want... and damn am I happy to see those cute, comic, Serbian faces.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        There isn't a good ending to this. It's been a collection of thoughts
        I've been chewing on for a while, and I don't think I'm ready to
        swallow. But after a few sessions with ChatGPT generating images... I
        don't know. I wanted to get these thoughts out there.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">
        Artists, visual and otherwise -- programmers, copywriters, everyone --
        the things you do have value despite AI's existence. That is a true
        statement. It is also true that AI gives people a seat at tables they'd
        never dream of otherwise, and that's a very special thing.
      </p>
      <p class="blogograph">I wonder what will happen.</p>
