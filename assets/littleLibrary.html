        Yes! It was I, Samuel Vidovich ( off in whose library ) who put those
        books in the little library. Questions answered:
        <br /><br />
        Q: Why?<br />
        A: Kids should read. There are one gorillion studies that show that kids
        who read have better life outcomes in general. It is also true that not
        everyone has the resources to give their kids books. Here are the books.
        <br /><br />
        Q: Where did you get the books?<br />
        A: Recently, Gorrell elementary in Massillon closed, and there was an
        auction. I bought a few things, namely a couple of boxes of children's
        books. There were a lot of duplicate books! What to do? What to do!?
        Throw them away!? No. Let's donate them. This is a new pastime of
        mine.<br /><br />
        Q: Why put your name on them?<br />
        A: I want credit. What's it to you? I'm vain. Now you're here.
        Wouldn't'a found me without it, I'd bet.<br /><br />
        Q: That's a little self-centered, don't you think?<br />
        A: What, do I owe you something? Get lost!<br /><br />
        Q: How come you didn't donate book X?<br />
        A: I didn't buy book X with the giant crate of books.<br /><br />
        Q: This would be better with book X.<br />
        A: ???<br /><br />
        Q: Are you going to do it again?<br />
        A: I am going to try and do this as much as I can. At the moment, it's
        kind of limited to "keep books in my car and cruise around looking for
        little libraries, or just dropping them off when I see them." There are
        maps of them out there.<br /><br />
        Q: Can I have a books? Pls.<br />
        A: Of course. Please reach out.<br /><br />
