<h4>
Linux from Scratch
</h4>

Linux from scratch is project where you take all of the packages which make up a linux distribution, and then build it from the ground up. It took a month and a half working each night to construct my Linux distribution, called <em>Archaea</em>, which runs on the metal of my Thinkpad T420.<br/>
<em>Archaea</em> is LFS version 8.3, and is a minimal installation. You can find it in the <em><a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/cgi-bin/lfscounter.php" target="blank">Get Counted</a></em> section of the LFS website under ID 27437, and you can find my compiled notes on Github. I have added
to this LFS since constructing it: it is now a 'BLFS' with i3 as a window manager, wireless management, a modern web browser, a file browser and more.


<h4>
    SRControl
</h4>
SRControl is a project that aims to bind Linux CGroups using python. It will allow users to execute specific functions in their own CGroups, as well as create and manage new CGroups generally.
<br/>
SRControl is released under GPLv3  and can be found <a href="https://github.com/svidovich/srcontrol/blob/master/LICENSE">here</a>. Feel free to issue pull requests!

<h4>
    LAD
</h4>
This new project will allow users to enter any Linux Allocated Device major/minor combination and return the device name, and vice-verse ( e.g. /dev/sda2 -> 8:3 ).<br/>
This project is yet unlicensed. It will likely be BSD, or something. You can contribute <a href="https://github.com/svidovich/lad">here</a>.

<h4>
    Homelab
</h4>
This is my personal home network. I use PFSense and a managed switch with a wireless access point. The server runs postgres, and the compute nodes collect and deliver network information to the database.
Also, it makes LAN parties very smooth.

<h4>
	NCurses Collection
</h4>
	This project is written in C. It uses the NCurses library, and has various attachments. Here is a preview of one that tracks mouse clicks and shoots fireworks at the click location:

</p>

<h4>
	Zelda Soundboard
</h4>
	This project is written in React Native. It is a soundboard that plays sounds from <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.</em> It runs on Android only... for now. Here's a preview:
<p align="center">

</p>

<h4>
	GeoIP Mapper
</h4>
This project is written in python. It uses the Shodan and MaxMind APIs to cross-reference zip codes, and allows a user to map IP addresses of any city in the United States on Google Earth. Here's a Preview:
<p align="center">

</p>

<h4>
	Virtual Honeypots (In progress)
</h4>
This project is written with bash scripts, following the curriculum of a book called <em>Virtual Honeypots</em>. This project allows a user to set up deceptive, emulated, high-interaction, scalable honeypots for network protection and investegation of an adversary's techniques.
<h4>
	Grand Exchange Analysis
</h4>
This project is written in python. A flask application communicates with a PostgreSQL instance in a docker container to grab item ids, and using this information, scrapes item price information from the Grand Exchange, the auction house of the online game <em>RuneScape</em>. Once the price information over the last 90 days is collected, the application runs one of three options in polynomial regression, returning an image of the regression curve overlaying the price values. The algorithm for regression is set up to run arbitrary degrees of regression. Here's a preview:
