Problem #9, p298.<br/>
The area of an arbitrary triangle can be computed using the formula<br/>
A =  sqrt(s*(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))<br/>
where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides, and s is the semiperimeter:<br/>
s = (a+b+c)/2<br/>
Write a <em>void</em> function that computes the area and perimeter of a triangle based on the
length of the sides. The function should use five parameters -- three value parameters that
provide the lengths of the edges, and two reference parameters that store the computer
area and perimeter. Make your function robust! Note that not all combinations of a, b and c produce a
triangle. Your function should produce correct results for legal deata and reasonable results for
illegal combinations.
<hr/>
Problem #7, p246.<br/>
The gravitational attractive force between two bodies with masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance d 
is given by:<br/>
F = (G*m1*m2)/d,<br/>
where G is the gravitational constant:<br/>
G = 6.673*10^(-8)[cm^3/g*sec^2]<br/>
Write a function definition that takes arguments for the masses of two bodies and the distance between them
and that returns the gravitational force. Since you will use the preceding formula, the gravitational force
will be in dynes; one dyne equals:<br/>
1 (g*cm/sec^2)<br/>
You should use a globally defined constant for the universal gravitational constant. Embed your function
definition in a complete program that computes the gravitational force between two objects given suitable inputs.
<hr/>
Project #2, p247.<br/>
Write a program that asks for the user's height, weight and age, then computes clothing sizes according to the following
formulae:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Hat Size = weight in pounds divided by height in inches, all multiplied by 2.9.
</li>
<li>
Jacket size (chest in inches)= height times weight divided by 288; adjust by adding 1/8 inch for each 10 years in age over 30.
</li>
<li>
Waist in inches = weight divided by 5.7 and then adjusted by adding 1/10 of an inch for each 2 years in age over 28.
</li>
</ul>
Use functions for each calculation.
<hr/>
Project #4, p299.<br/>
Write a program that tells what coins to give out for any amount of change from 1 cent to 99 cents. For example, if the amount
is 86 cents, the output would be something like this:<br/>
>>>86 cents can be given as<br/>
>>>3 quarter(s) 1 dime(s) and 1 pennies<br/>
Use coind denominations of 25 cents, 10 cents, and 1 cent. Do <strong>not</strong> use nickels or half dollar coins.
