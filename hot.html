Problem #7, p298.<br/>
Write a program tha tmerges the numbers in two files and writes all the numbers into a third file. Your program takes
input from two different files and writes all the output to a third file. Each input file contains a list of numbers
of type <em>int</em> in sorted order from the smallest to the largest. After the program is run, the output file will
contain all the numbers in the two input files in one longer list in sorted order from smallest to largest. Your program
should define a function that is called with the two input-file streams and the output-file stream as three arguments. Don't
have any input files? Make them yourself!
<hr/>
Problem #9, p298.<br/>
The area of an arbitrary triangle can be computed using the formula<br/>
A =  sqrt(s*(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))<br/>
where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides, and s is the semiperimeter:<br/>
s = (a+b+c)/2<br/>
Write a <em>void</em> function that computes the area and perimeter of a triangle based on the
length of the sides. The function should use five parameters -- three value parameters that
provide the lengths of the edges, and two reference parameters that store the computer
area and perimeter. Make your function robust! Note that not all combinations of a, b and c produce a
triangle. Your function should produce correct results for legal deata and reasonable results for
illegal combinations.
<hr/>
Problem #7, p246.<br/>
The gravitational attractive force between two bodies with masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance d 
is given by:<br/>
F = (G*m1*m2)/d,<br/>
where G is the gravitational constant:<br/>
G = 6.673*10^(-8)[cm^3/g*sec^2]<br/>
Write a function definition that takes arguments for the masses of two bodies and the distance between them
and that returns the gravitational force. Since you will use the preceding formula, the gravitational force
will be in dynes; one dyne equals:<br/>
1 (g*cm/sec^2)<br/>
You should use a globally defined constant for the universal gravitational constant. Embed your function
definition in a complete program that computes the gravitational force between two objects given suitable inputs.

Project #2, p368. <strong><h3>TUFF</h3></strong><br/>
Write a program to compute numeric grades for a course. The course records are in a file that will serve as the input
file. The input file is in exactly the following format: Each line contains a student's last name, then one space, then
the student's first name, then one space, then ten quiz scores all on one line; the quiz scores are whole numbers and are
separated by one space. Your program will take its input from this file and send its output to a second file. The data
in the output file will be the same as the data in the input file except that there will be one additional number of type
<em>double</em> at the end of each line. This number will be the average of the studet's ten quiz scores. Use at least one
function that has file streams as all or some of its arguments.
<hr/>
Project #2, p247.<br/>
Write a program that asks for the user's height, weight and age, then computes clothing sizes according to the following
formulae:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Hat Size = weight in pounds divided by height in inches, all multiplied by 2.9.
</li>
<li>
Jacket size (chest in inches)= height times weight divided by 288; adjust by adding 1/8 inch for each 10 years in age over 30.
</li>
<li>
Waist in inches = weight divided by 5.7 and then adjusted by adding 1/10 of an inch for each 2 years in age over 28.
</li>
</ul>
Use functions for each calculation.
<hr/>
Project #4, p299.<br/>
Write a program that tells what coins to give out for any amount of change from 1 cent to 99 cents. For example, if the amount
is 86 cents, the output would be something like this:<br/>
>>>86 cents can be given as<br/>
>>>3 quarter(s) 1 dime(s) and 1 pennies<br/>
Use coind denominations of 25 cents, 10 cents, and 1 cent. Do <strong>not</strong> use nickels or half dollar coins.
