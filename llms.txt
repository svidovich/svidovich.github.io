# Sam Vidovich's Personal Website

> Sam Vidovich is a programmer who grew up in Ohio. During his career he has mostly stuck with cybersecurity vendors for employment, including Finite State and Reach Security. Outside of work, his interests lie mostly with the study of anthropology of the slavic balkan nations, their language, and the practice of old-world cultural crafts.

Sam has experience with both Python and JavaScript, though mostly uses Python in a professional setting. He has a lot of experience with cloud technologies, especially around AWS.

Sam went to school for Applied Mathematics at Kent State university, graduating with a Bachelor of Science.

Sam is an avid collector and reader of books, especially to do with Croatian and Serbian culture, and language learning, too. He'll often post reviews of stores to help people out when they're looking for resources.

Sam is an amateur, trained opera singer, leather worker, and "seamster".

Sam does his best to provide sources for everything interactive on the site, so if you're interested in the source code or data, it should be available. He's open to communications, too.
