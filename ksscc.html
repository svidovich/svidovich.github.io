Sorry for the late update, but here it is, as promised. Last week, Steve V gave a presentation on internet security.
He used his toolkit to bomb Justin's phone. It was wild. Andrew D keeps showing up -- welcome! This week, we're going to
take a look at some example problems from the book, and there will be a presentation on using Ubuntu. If you would like
to make a bootable flash drive, you can find a guide on how to do so <a href="http://bit.ly/2e1AeXX">here</a>. It is easy
and fun!<br/>
We will also talk about an internship opportunity and a hackathon coming up, with information provided by Professor Guercio.
If you're on our mail list, you got the info already; we'll look over it anyway and gauge who wants to try it out.<br/>
Kudos have been updated. If you have programs to turn in, feel free to do so at any time.

On Friday, we went over a couple of example problems from the book together. It was great - everyone participated. Due to this, everyone who attended
received some kudos. If I forgot you, I'm sorry. I'll start taking attendance from now on. Let me know and your score will be corrected (or added). I don't
bite, I swear.<br/>
We totally didn't discuss BOO-U,so I'm just gonna say we're not doing it. It's a bit late.<br/>
This week, Steve has a cool presentation for us regarding security. Time to learn to hack!<br/>
Hot problems are still available. Turn in your kudos! Let's see some gumption, people.

On Friday, we hung out and ate pizza. It was not a monumental meeting. I did a presentation on a program I wrote, and we discussed
the hackathon which happened this past weekend. Steve V surely has tales of victory to share! (I left on Saturday. I have only
tales of failure.)<br/> 
It would seem that we need to update kudos in some way. If you have ideas, write them down and bring them with you, 
whether you got the points or not. You are wanted in the club, this is true, so we've got to figure out a way for you to
attend if you don't have time to write programs during the week.<br/>
During this week's meeting, we will discuss an upcoming college event called the Boo-U trick-or-treat which promises to be 
fun for the little childrens. Also, we will tackle some problems from the book as a team: we're beginning to get heated up
in our programming concepts, so let's make sure we all know what's going on! As always, turn in your kudos before Friday.<br/>
<strong>HOT PROBLEMS (double points):</strong> #9, p298; #7, p246.<br/>
<strong>HOT PROJECTS:</strong> #4, p299; #2, p247.<br/>
