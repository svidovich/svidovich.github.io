On Friday, we hung out and ate pizza. It was not a monumental meeting. I did a presentation on a program I wrote, and we discussed
the hackathon which happened this past weekend. Steve V surely has tales of victory to share! (I left on Saturday. I have only
tales of failure.)<br/> 
It would seem that we need to update kudos in some way. If you have ideas, write them down and bring them with you, 
whether you got the points or not. You are wanted in the club, this is true, so we've got to figure out a way for you to
attend if you don't have time to write programs during the week.<br/>
During this week's meeting, we will discuss an upcoming college event called the Boo-U trick-or-treat which promises to be 
fun for the little childrens. Also, we will tackle some problems from the book as a team: we're beginning to get heated up
in our programming concepts, so let's make sure we all know what's going on! As always, turn in your kudos before Friday.<br/>
<strong>HOT PROBLEMS (double points):</strong> #9, p298; #7, p246.<br/>
<strong>HOT PROJECTS:</strong> #4, p299; #2, p247.<br/>
